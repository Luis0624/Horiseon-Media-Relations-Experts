            <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
            <p>
                The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they 
                travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to 
                increase your visibility and find the right customers for your business.

            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone
                 with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online 
                 Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they 
                 search for your business.

            <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
            <p>
                Social media continues to have a sizable influence on buying habits. Social media marketing 
                helps you determine which platforms are suited to your brand, using analytics to find the 
                right markets and increase your lead generation.
